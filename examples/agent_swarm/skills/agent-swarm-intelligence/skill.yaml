  Advanced multi-agent intelligence system that orchestrates specialized AI agents
  for comprehensive research, analysis, and content generation.
  
  Features:
  - Multi-agent orchestration with 6 specialized agents
  - Deep research capabilities across multiple domains
  - Intelligent planning and task decomposition
  - Quality assurance through critic and reflection agents
  - Structured summarization and content refinement
  - Collaborative intelligence emergence
  
  Agent Swarm Architecture:
  - Planner Agent: Breaks down complex tasks into structured steps
  - Researcher Agent: Conducts deep research and information gathering
  - Summarizer Agent: Creates concise, structured summaries
  - Critic Agent: Provides quality assessment and content improvement
  - Reflection Agent: Evaluates output quality and suggests improvements
  - Orchestrator: Coordinates all agents and manages workflow
  
  This system demonstrates the future of AI - collaborative agent societies
  working together to produce high-quality, comprehensive outputs.
